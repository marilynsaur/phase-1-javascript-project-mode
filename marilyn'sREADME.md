# **Build a train** App

Created an App where the User can look up and build trading cards that contain different types of trains. Each
trading card contains the name of the train, description, facts and also a like button where the User can see how
many likes that each train card has.

# List of things that the App does

1. The User can access an list of trains from an API and each train is rendered in its own card with data.

2. The User can also put in their data in the form and create their own train trading card using an event listener so that
when the data is submitted the new train is added to the Json database and it's shown on the page.

3. There's a like button on each card and when the user clicks on it they can also see how the numerical number of likes
the card has collected.
